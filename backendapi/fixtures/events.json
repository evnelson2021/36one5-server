            "details": "Featuring the work of renowned British installation artist Bruce Munro, LIGHT: Bruce Munro at Cheekwood celebrates the 10th anniversary of an exhibition by the same name held at Cheekwood in 2013. As a campus-wide, immersive intervention highlighting significant advancements in illuminative technology, LIGHT has been expanded in scope and scale for 2023. It is designed to respond to and enhance the outdoor garden and indoor gallery experiences, encouraging an awareness of our individual and collective journeys through time and space. The interplay between Munro's three-dimensional creations and the surrounding environment - at dusk and after dark - heightens the sense of time's passage, reinforced through works with expressed childhood and literary themes. Whether backlit sea glass or pigment on paper, his two-dimensional works likewise comment on life through the “language of light.” Munro underscores that, just as he has changed as an individual in the ten years since his previous exhibition at Cheekwood, so too has his relationship with the site, technology, and the world around him.",

Listening to The Boxmasters, one can hear obvious odes to the Beatles, Byrds, and Beach Boys, but also important to The Boxmasters are The Mothers of Invention, Kris Kristofferson, John Prine, and Big Star. Since forming The Boxmasters, several long-time friends have contributed to the sound of the band, but the core of The Boxmasters has always been Andrew and Thornton. As primary songwriters, the sound of the Boxmasters has been an evolution as the duo constantly strives to find new inspiration, new sounds, and new ways of expressing what is in their hearts and on their minds. But at the core, there is a backbeat, a lyric with meaning and music played with emotion. As a touring band, The Boxmasters have cultivated a rabid cult fanbase across the United States and Canada. Opening for the likes of ZZ Top, Steve Miller, George Thorogood, and Kid Rock The Boxmasters have proven to win over large audiences. As a headliner, frequent stops in Kansas City at “Knuckleheads”, Springfield, Illinois at “Boondocks” and “Merrimack Hall” in Huntsville, Alabama have shown dedicated yet still growing audiences. Two appearances at Levon Helm's “Midnight Ramble” in Woodstock, New York were highlight performances for the band, as well as the “Ramble at The Ryman” that Levon hosted in 2008. The Boxmasters performed on “The Grand Ole Opry” in 2015, another in a growing resume of must-play venues.",
